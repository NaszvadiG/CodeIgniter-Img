CodeIgniter - Img

Simple Code Igniter library to generate
high quality thumbnails

by Slawomir Jasinski
======================================

Hey everybody,

Library is based on excellent * Smarty plugin "Thumb" * created in 2005 by Christoph Erdmann.
My version is a little bit different, I'm using core from Thumb, and some modification which
gives me more flexibility to work with it.

DOCUMENTATION:
Documentation is located at http://www.spidersoft.com.au/projects/codeigniter-img-thumbnails-on-the-fly/

INSTALLATION:
Just put img.php file in libraries path.

USING THE LIBRARY:

Loading library
$this->load->library('img');

In view you can use function with this parameters:

echo $this->img->rimg($filename, array('longside' => 745, 'alt' => 'alt text')

Parameters:

longside – width of longest side (pixel value),
shortside – width of shorter side
crop – cropping (true/false)
width – fixed width (with this parameter you need also set height)
height – height (with this parameter you need to also set height)
sharpen – sharp image after scale
nocache – rewrite existing file in the cache


Feel free to send me an email if you have any problems.


Thanks,
