======================================

Hey everybody,

Library is bases on excellent * Smarty plugin "Thumb" * created in 2005 by 2005 Christoph Erdmann.
My version is a little bit different, I'm using core from Thumb, and some modification which
gives me more flexibility to work with it.

DOCUMENTATION:
Documentation is located at https://github.com/slav123/CodeIgniter-Img/wiki

INSTALLATION:
Just put img.php file in libraries path.

USING THE LIBRARY:
Rest of instruction will be provided ASAP

Feel free to send me an email if you have any problems.


Thanks,
